Firstly:

You can find "signal_Fc0SPS4ModuQPSKSNR15.bin" in "SDR_GPU/Signal" Folder

It is modulated signal with QPSK signal modulation format with RRC pulse shaping 
The channel asume Awgn with 15dB SNR in Bandwidth

For this signal Sample Per Symbol ratio is 4 but it works for all other ratio which is greater that 2 (Gardner Algorithm Limitation)

---------------------------------------------
Secondly:

All code has been developed in MATLAB 2019b
