# SDR_GPU
This project is created by: Mohammad Hasan Shammakhi

## Gardner_Parallel
In this folder we have two version of timing recovery based on Gardner algorithm:
  - The method which is explain in **GPU-Based Parallel Algorithm for Wideband Signal Timing Recovery**
  - The forward-backward method which will be published soon in an article

## PLL_Parallel/ForwardBackward
It is about The implementation of GPU based Phased Locked Loop for PSK signals in CUDA.
To fully understand the details of this work and to see the results, please see [this](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4100444) article

## QPSKDemodulation
It is a project for Coursera *GPU specialization*.

## Signal

In this folder we upload some signals for testing the algorithms.
